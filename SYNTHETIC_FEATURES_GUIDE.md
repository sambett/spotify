# Synthetic Audio Features - Complete Guide

## Overview

This system automatically generates **deterministic synthetic audio features** for tracks that lack real Spotify API features. This is essential because:

1. **403 Error Workaround**: The Spotify `/v1/audio-features` endpoint currently returns 403 Forbidden
2. **Testing & Validation**: Provides complete data coverage for pipeline development
3. **Academic Project Continuity**: Ensures you can build Silver/Gold layers without waiting for API fixes
4. **Reproducibility**: Hash-based seeding ensures identical results across runs

## How It Works

### 1. Deterministic Feature Generation

Each `track_id` gets the **same synthetic features every time** using SHA256 hash-based seeding:

```python
# track_id: "3n3Ppam7vgaVa1iaRUc9Lp"
seed = sha256("3n3Ppam7vgaVa1iaRUc9Lp").digest()[:8]  # Deterministic seed
rng = random.Random(seed)  # Seeded random generator

danceability = 0.15 + rng.betavariate(2, 2) * 0.70  # Always same value
energy = 0.10 + rng.betavariate(2, 2) * 0.80
valence = 0.10 + rng.betavariate(2, 2) * 0.75
# ... etc
```

**Result**: Running the script 100 times produces identical features for each track.

### 2. Feature Ranges (Realistic Spotify-like Values)

| Feature | Range | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| `danceability` | 0.15 - 0.85 | How suitable for dancing |
| `energy` | 0.10 - 0.90 | Intensity and activity measure |
| `valence` | 0.10 - 0.85 | Musical positiveness (happiness) |
| `acousticness` | 0.05 - 0.95 | Acoustic vs electronic |
| `instrumentalness` | 0.00 - 0.80 | Likelihood of no vocals |
| `speechiness` | 0.03 - 0.50 | Presence of spoken words |
| `liveness` | 0.05 - 0.40 | Presence of audience |
| `loudness` | -25.0 - -3.0 | Overall loudness in dB |
| `tempo` | 60 - 180 | Speed in BPM |
| `time_signature` | [3, 4, 5] | Beats per bar |
| `key` | [0-11] | Musical key (0=C, 1=C#, etc.) |
| `mode` | [0, 1] | Major (1) or Minor (0) |

### 3. Automatic Pipeline Integration

The pipeline automatically populates missing features:

```
Listening History Ingestion
         ‚Üì
Track Features Ingestion (may fail with 403)
         ‚Üì
Kaggle Dataset Loading
         ‚Üì
üÜï AUTOMATIC SYNTHETIC POPULATION
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Find tracks in listening history
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Check which have real features (prefer real!)
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Check which have synthetic features (skip if exists)
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Generate synthetic for remaining tracks
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Append to synthetic features table
```

### 4. Bronze Layer Structure

After running the pipeline, you'll have:

```
data/bronze/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ listening_history_bronze/              # Your Spotify plays
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 1,000 events with timestamps
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ my_tracks_features_bronze/             # Real features (mostly NULL due to 403)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 47 tracks (0 with complete features)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ my_tracks_features_bronze_synthetic/   # üÜï Synthetic features
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 47 tracks (100% coverage)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ kaggle_tracks_bronze/                  # Kaggle catalog
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 114,001 tracks
```

### 5. Silver Layer Feature Preference

The Silver layer intelligently merges features with preference order:

```
PREFERENCE: Real > Synthetic > Kaggle

For each track in listening history:
  IF real features exist (non-NULL):
    USE real features ‚úÖ (best)
  ELSE IF synthetic features exist:
    USE synthetic features ‚úÖ (good for testing)
  ELSE IF Kaggle features exist:
    USE Kaggle features ‚úÖ (fallback)
  ELSE:
    NULL ‚ö†Ô∏è
```

The `feature_source` column tracks provenance: `'real'`, `'synthetic'`, or `'kaggle'`.

## Environment Toggle (Kill-Switch)

### ALLOW_SYNTHETIC Environment Variable

Control synthetic feature generation with a single environment variable:

```bash
# Enable synthetic features (default)
export ALLOW_SYNTHETIC=true
docker-compose up -d spotify-scheduler

# Disable synthetic features
export ALLOW_SYNTHETIC=false
docker-compose up -d spotify-scheduler
```

**Behavior when disabled:**
- Pipeline continues normally
- Synthetic feature generation is skipped
- Logs show: `‚ö†Ô∏è  Synthetic feature generation is DISABLED`
- Silver layer uses real + Kaggle features only

**Use cases:**
- **Development/Testing**: `ALLOW_SYNTHETIC=true` (get full coverage)
- **Production** (when 403 fixed): `ALLOW_SYNTHETIC=false` (real data only)
- **Academic Validation**: Toggle to compare real vs synthetic impact

---

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Generate Synthetic Features Manually

```bash
# Generate synthetic features for all tracks in listening history
docker-compose run --rm spotify-pipeline \
  python3 scripts/generate_synthetic_audio_features.py \
  --history-path /app/data/bronze/listening_history_bronze \
  --out-path /app/data/bronze/my_tracks_features_bronze_synthetic
```

**Output:**
```
================================================================================

```

### Example 2: Populate Missing Features Automatically

```bash
# Run the automatic populator (detects what's missing)
docker-compose run --rm spotify-pipeline \
  python3 scripts/populate_missing_features.py \
  --history-path /app/data/bronze/listening_history_bronze \
  --real-features-path /app/data/bronze/my_tracks_features_bronze \

```

### Example 4: Run Full Pipeline (Automatic Mode)

The pipeline now automatically populates missing features:

```bash
# Run pipeline once (includes automatic synthetic population)
docker-compose run --rm spotify-pipeline python3 run_ingestion.py
```

**Pipeline Steps:**
1. ‚úÖ Fetch listening history (1,000 plays)
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è  Fetch track features (fails with 403)
3. ‚úÖ Load Kaggle dataset (114K tracks)
4. üÜï **Automatically populate missing features with synthetic data**
5. ‚úÖ Pipeline complete

**Or run scheduled collection:**
```bash
# Start scheduler (runs every 6 hours, auto-populates each time)
docker-compose up -d spotify-scheduler

# View logs
docker logs -f spotify-scheduler
```

---

## Data Quality & Validation

### Coverage Statistics

After running the pipeline, check your coverage:

```python
# In Silver layer
SELECT
    feature_source,
    COUNT(*) as count,
    ROUND(COUNT(*) * 100.0 / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM listening_with_features), 1) as percentage
FROM listening_with_features
GROUP BY feature_source;
```

**Expected Results (with synthetic features enabled):**

| feature_source | count | percentage |
|----------------|-------|------------|
| synthetic      | 850   | 85.0%      |
| kaggle         | 150   | 15.0%      |
| **Total**      | **1000** | **100.0%** |

### Verification: Same Track, Same Features

```python
# Generate features twice, verify they're identical
from scripts.generate_synthetic_audio_features import SyntheticAudioFeatureGenerator

gen = SyntheticAudioFeatureGenerator()
track_id = "3n3Ppam7vgaVa1iaRUc9Lp"

features_run1 = gen._generate_features_for_track(track_id)
features_run2 = gen._generate_features_for_track(track_id)

assert features_run1 == features_run2  # ‚úÖ Always identical
```

---

## Safety & Best Practices

### ‚úÖ Safe Operations

1. **Idempotent**: Running scripts multiple times is safe
2. **Append-only**: Synthetic features are appended (Delta Lake handles duplicates)
3. **Non-destructive**: Never modifies real features or listening history
4. **Deterministic**: Same input = same output every time
5. **Logged**: All operations clearly logged with coverage statistics

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Development Use**: Synthetic features are for **testing and validation**
2. **Real Features Preferred**: Silver layer always prefers real API features
3. **Clear Provenance**: `feature_source` column tracks data origin
4. **Academic Honesty**: Document synthetic data use in your report
5. **Production Toggle**: Use `ALLOW_SYNTHETIC=false` when real features work

### üö® What NOT To Do

- ‚ùå Don't use synthetic features for production recommendations (yet)
- ‚ùå Don't claim synthetic features are real in academic reports
- ‚ùå Don't disable the kill-switch in production without real features
- ‚ùå Don't modify the seed generation algorithm (breaks reproducibility)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No synthetic features generated"

**Check 1: Is ALLOW_SYNTHETIC enabled?**
```bash
echo $ALLOW_SYNTHETIC  # Should output: true
```

**Check 2: Do you have listening history?**
```bash
docker-compose run --rm spotify-pipeline \
  python3 -c "
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
spark = SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate()
df = spark.read.format('delta').load('/app/data/bronze/listening_history_bronze')
print(f'Listening events: {df.count()}')
"
```

### Issue: "Feature populator script not found"

**Solution:** Ensure scripts directory is mounted in docker-compose.yml:
```yaml
volumes:
  - ./scripts:/app/scripts  # ‚Üê Must be present
```

### Issue: "Coverage still 0% after synthetic generation"

**Likely cause:** Silver layer not built yet. Run:
```bash
docker-compose run --rm spotify-pipeline \
  python3 scripts/build_silver_listening_with_features.py
```

## Academic Project Integration

### Mention in Your Report

**Example Section:**

> **Data Quality Note**
>
> Due to Spotify API permission limitations (403 Forbidden on `/v1/audio-features` endpoint),
> we implemented a deterministic synthetic feature generation system for testing and validation.
> Synthetic features are:
> - Generated using hash-based seeding (SHA256 of `track_id`) for reproducibility
> - Distributed using realistic ranges based on Spotify API documentation
> - Clearly marked with `source='synthetic'` in the data model
> - Used only where real API features are unavailable (0/47 personal tracks)
> - Supplemented by authentic Kaggle dataset features (114K tracks)
>
> The Silver layer prioritizes real features, with synthetic serving as fallback for
> pipeline development. Coverage analysis shows 85% synthetic, 15% Kaggle features.

### For Your Defense

**Potential Question**: "Why use synthetic data?"

**Answer**:
- Demonstrates robust data engineering practices (handling API failures gracefully)
- Enables full pipeline development without blocking on external API issues
- Shows understanding of data provenance and quality tracking
- Reproducible: hash-based generation ensures consistent results for validation
- Kaggle dataset (114K tracks) provides authentic features for comparative analysis
